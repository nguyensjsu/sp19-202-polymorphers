# Egg Catcher by team Polymorphers
This is a fun and easy to play game where you will prove yourself a real hero of egg catcher. You will be controlling a rabbit who will catch the falling eggs and collect them in a basket. The more eggs you collect, the more you score. White eggs carry one point each, whereas, Silver and Golden eggs carry five and ten points each respectively. You will get three chances of dropping the eggs after which the game will end. Challenge yourself to beat your previous high score and switch to a higher difficulty once you are a pro!

### Design:
This game is built using Greenfoot and uses Greenfoot game engine. We have built it from scratch without using existing codebase. We have implemented the following design patterns in its creation:
1. Observer - To implement various functionalities such as scoreboard, lives, egg miss and egg catch.
2. Decorator - For wrapping the base class White Egg with Golden Egg and Silver Egg.
3. State - The functionality of adding eggs and removing eggs from the basket is built using state pattern.
4. Strategy - To change difficulty upon clicking switch mode button.
5. Command - To pass a command and change views such as Start Game, Switch Mode and High Score.
